- Comment on assuming invariants.
	- For intro to folding, the _programmer_ can assume that invariants hold. Be more explicit in the text about that.
- Names for family of places and trees. ($P$ and $T$?)
	- If "places" are not used too much, consider using $\mathbf{Places}$.
- Show fold and unfold are inverse
- [[Figure – Folding tree folding sequence]] and [[Figure – Folding tree requires sequence]] notation needs to be cleaned up.
- Describing stuck
	- I think we take the implicit route:
		- If there are no inference rules to take, then the program gets stuck.
