The _abstract-syntax tree_ layer provides a fully type-safe way to traverse syntax. Contrary to how ASTs are often implemented, using in-memory data types with concrete fields for children, the AST in Mist is only a projection over the CST. This allows high reuse of the underlying data to minimize overall memory usage.

Each AST node contains a pointer into the CST and provides type-safe accessors for children and even parents. These accessors are generated directly from the grammar (see [[Appendix â€“ The Mist Grammar]]), resulting in about 3500 lines of highly repetitive code. AST nodes also maintain the their span in the source file, to provide source code locations for diagnostics and semantic highlighting.

```rust
enum Item {
  Fn(Fn),
  Struct(Struct),
  TypeInvariant(TypeInvariant),
}
```

```rust
struct Fn { syntax: SyntaxNode }
impl Fn {
  fn fn_token(&self) -> Option<SyntaxToken> { .. }
  fn name(&self) -> Option<Name> { .. }
  fn param_list(&self) -> Option<ParamList> { .. }
  fn thin_arrow_token(&self) -> Option<SyntaxToken> { .. }
  fn ret(&self) -> Option<Type> { .. }
  fn conditions(&self) -> AstChildren<Condition> { .. }
  fn decreases(&self) -> Option<Decreases> { .. }
  fn body(&self) -> Option<BlockExpr> { .. }
  fn semicolon_token(&self) -> Option<SyntaxToken> { .. }
}
```
