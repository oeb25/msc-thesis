Let $\T$ be a folding tree represented as a set of places, where every prefix of a place in $\T$ is also in $\T$. Nodes in the tree can either be _folded_ or _unfolded_, where folded nodes are leaves and unfolded nodes are internal nodes. All places have a set of associated fields, and unfolded nodes will have all of their fields as children.

Additionally, let $\Ts$ represent the set of all trees.
