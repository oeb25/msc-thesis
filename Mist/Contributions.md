- We present in [[The Mist Programming Language]] a new programming language, Mist, which supports formal verification constructs with a high emphasis on usability.
- We present in [[The Mist Compiler]] an implementation of the compilation infrastructure for Mist based on incremental compilation and verification, with an accompanying implementation of the Language Server Protocol.
- In [[Automatic folding of isorecursive structures]], we formalize an algorithm for computing folding- and unfolding-points for isorecursive structures and give a formally verified implementation of the algorithm in Mist.

We conclude with related and future work in [[Conclusion]].
