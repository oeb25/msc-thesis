Let $\rho$ be a place of with fields $f_1,\dots,f_n$, then we say that $\fields(\rho)$ is the set of places of the fields of $\rho$. Formally:
$$
\fields(\rho) = \{ \rho.f_1, \dots, \rho.f_n \}
$$
For places with types without fields, such as `int` and `bool`, we define $\fields(\rho) = \emptyset$.
