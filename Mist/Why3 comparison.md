title: Why3
---

is a platform for deductive program verification, [[@why3]] with a bias for ML style programming, differentiating it slightly from Mist and the other languages considered here but carries the same principles. Why3 has ghost code [[@filliatreSpiritGhostCode2016]] as a formal part of their type system and inference. Type declarations in Why3 can have both predicates and invariants. Creusot [[@denisCreusotFoundryDeductive2022]] shows Why3 can play a similar role to what Viper does for Prusti by using Why3 as a backend for verifying Rust code.
