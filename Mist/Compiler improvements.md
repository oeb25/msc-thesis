A compiler is a complex piece of software, and this project has been focused on exploring features and analyses rather than entirely on building a bug-free compiler, although we have tried to do so when possible. Nevertheless, the compiler stability needs improvement, as it contains mis$^\text{\tiny \textcolor{Gray700}{t}}$compilations, bugs, and partially implemented features.
