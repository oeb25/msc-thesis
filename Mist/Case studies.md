In addition to the examples presented in prior chapters, this chapter studies two programs, each selected to highlight specific properties of the Mist language. The first focuses on working with lists, mixing `ghost` and `pure` code, and applying those in implementations of algorithms. The second is a condensation of everything involved in working with, compiling, and verifying programs containing structs, and compares this to how it might be done in similar languages.
