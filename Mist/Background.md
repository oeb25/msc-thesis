This chapter introduces concepts and necessary background information for the remaining chapters. We give a brief introduction to program verification and Viper in [[Automated program verification tools]], outline what modularity and abstraction are and what role it plays in verification and programming in general in [[Abstraction and modularity]], and give an explanation of the benefits of incremental computation in [[Incremental computation]].
