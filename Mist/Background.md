This chapter introduces concepts and necessary background information for the remaining chapters. We give a brief introduction to program verification and Viper in [[Program verification]], outline what modularity is and what role it plays in verification and programming in general in [[Modularity]], and give an explanation of the benefits of incremental computation in [[Incremental computation]].
