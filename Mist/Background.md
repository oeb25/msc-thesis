This chapter introduces concepts and necessary background information for the remaining chapters. We start by briefly introducing program verification and Viper in [[Automated program verification tools]]. Next, outline what modularity and abstraction are and their role in verification and general programming in [[Abstraction and modularity]]. Lastly, explain the benefits of incremental computation in [[Incremental computation]].
