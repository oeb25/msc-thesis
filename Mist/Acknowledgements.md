I would like to thank my advisor Christoph Matheja for always being helpful, transparent, and ready to discuss any idea or issue I might have had, even on unreasonably short notice. I would like to thank Mikkel Denker for providing excellent feedback and comments, Camilla FÃ¦rch for being a great collaborator even when working on different projects, and Magnus Hamann Poulsen for all the support and the invaluable long bike rides. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their constant support throughout my studies.
