## Notes

> The use of abstract predicates to facilitate data abstraction in separation logics is well established [[@parkinsonSeparationLogicAbstraction2005]], and captures the software engineering principle of representation hiding: just as the client program of an abstract data type (ADT) can be written without knowing the representation, verification of the client can proceed without knowing the representation invariant. In type theory, this is the principle of existential types [[@mitchellAbstractTypesExistential1988]].
