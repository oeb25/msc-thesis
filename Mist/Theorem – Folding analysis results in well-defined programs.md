Let $\inst_1, \dots, \inst_n \in \Inst$ be a sequence of instructions in a folding augmented program, and let $\A(\pp_i)$ be a folding tree given by folding analysis for the first instruction in the sequence, then sequentially executing _all instructions in the sequence will be well-defined in terms of foldings_, i.e.
$$
\A(\pp_i) \vdash \inst_1 \;;\; \dots \;;\; \inst_n
$$
