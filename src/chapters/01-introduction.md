# Introduction {#chap:intro}

Contributions:

- We present in +@chap:mist a new programming language, Mist, which supports
  formal verification constructs with a high emphasis on usability.
- We present in +@chap:compiler an implementation of the compilation infrastructure for Mist
  based on incremental compilation and verification, with an accompanying
  implementation of the Language Server Protocol.
<!-- - Process for lowering a CFG into and imparative and expression oriented form. -->
- In +@chap:folding we formalize an algorithm for computing folding- and
  unfolding-points for isorecursive structures, and give a formally verified
  implementation of the algorithm in Mist.

We conclude with related and future work in +@chap:conclusion.
